# This same script is the updater — it's idempotent, preserves an edited

#
# It builds from source on your machine rather than shipping a binary. That's
# deliberate: a downloaded unsigned binary gets quarantined by Gatekeeper and
# needs a right-click-open dance, while something you compiled locally just
# runs. It also means you can read exactly what you're installing.
#
# Everything lives inside main(), invoked on the very last line. Under
# `curl | sh` the shell executes the script AS IT STREAMS — if the connection
# dropped halfway through a top-down script, the downloaded prefix would run
# and the rest never would. With the wrapper, a truncated download dies parsing
# an unterminated function instead of half-installing.

  He updates himself when a new version lands (menu bar -> Auto-Update
  to turn that off). To remove him completely:
