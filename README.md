# rubin-buddy

An 8-bit desktop buddy — bald dome, shades, enormous beard, all black — who sits
on top of your windows, reacts to what Claude Code is doing, and occasionally
says something worth hearing.

Rick-Rubin-inspired homage. Not a likeness anyone would mistake for the real
thing, and the things he says are written for the character, not quoted from him.

## New: headphones, and a window to stand on

**He puts his headphones on when your music plays** — Spotify, Apple Music,
a YouTube tab, anything. His hands go up, the Claude-orange cups go on, and he
nods along at about 100 BPM with a note rising off the beat. Claude working or
finishing doesn't interrupt the groove — the menu bar shows it — but Claude
*needing* you does: headphones off, shades up. Stop the music and they come off.

Spotify and Apple Music announce play and pause to the whole system, so they
get an instant reaction. Everything else comes from Core Audio's list of which
apps are sending sound to the speakers — no permission, and nothing of the
sound itself, only which apps are making some. That's checked once a second;
it takes three seconds of steady sound to count, so a notification ding
doesn't put the headphones on, and four of quiet to stop. A call isn't music:
an app using the microphone as well is left out, and so are the usual meeting
apps (Zoom, Teams, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp…). Any sound counts, so a talking
YouTube video counts too. `~/.rubin-buddy/state.sh groove` puts the
headphones on by hand. Off under **Headphones with Music**.

**He stands on the window you're working in.** Feet on its title bar, a soft
shadow underneath. Drag the window and he rides along. Switch to another and
he jumps for it: he sinks low, glows Claude-orange as sparks climb around him,
trembles, the light catches his shades — and he launches, leaving a burst
behind, tucks and spins through the air, and lands hard in a puff of dust.
With the headphones on he does it all with them on, and lands still grooving.
Short distances get a plain hop. Close a window and he goes to whatever's in
front next. Seated, he glides rather than jumps.

A maximized window has no room above it, so he goes inside it: to the top-right
corner under the toolbar, away from the bottom where you type. Put him
somewhere else inside an app's window and that's his spot in that app from
then on; drop him back on a window's top edge and he stands on top again.
Dragged along a top edge, he remembers where along it. With nothing open, he
goes back to his usual spot on the desktop.

The window list he reads gives positions and owners without any permission;
titles would need Screen Recording, and he never asks. It's checked the moment
you switch apps, twice a second otherwise (about a millisecond each), and every
frame while a window is being dragged. Fresh installs start with it on; if you already had him, he keeps the
spot you gave him until you choose **Stand on Your Window**.

**And a glow-up.** He breathes with his feet planted — his whole body used to
bob, which looked fine floating in a corner and wrong standing on something.
A contact shadow under every grounded pose, a glint that slides across the
shades now and then, steam off the tea, and the stretch no longer leaves a
spare pair of hands at his hips.

## A little more useful, just as quiet

Click Rick’s menu bar head to open his companion panel. Right-click the sprite
for the full settings menu. Keep a thought, copy it as a PNG picture, browse
saved thoughts, take a breath, or start a quiet 25-minute sit. Thoughts and the
last spoken line survive restarts. There are no streaks or activity analytics.
A sit silences unprompted chatter and leaves Rick seated while agent status
continues to update. It survives restarts until its original deadline. Cancel
at any time. Updates defer during a sit or guided breath.

Text size is independent of character size. Rick respects macOS Reduce Motion.
The optional menu bar status says Working, Needs you, Ready, or Check session;
idle gestures never change that status. Multiple sessions are listed separately
in the companion panel. “Clear reviewed completions” acknowledges only finished
turns, never permission requests, and a new completion appears again.

### Repair an older installation

The GitHub repository moved from `otniel-bit` to `Gitmealez`. The old install
and update URLs return 404. Older apps cannot discover the new location by
themselves. Run the install command above once; it preserves preferences and
edited lines, refreshes already-connected hooks, and repairs the updater.
New installers and updaters use the stable website `/install.sh` address.

### Follow Codex coding tasks

Choose **Settings → Follow Codex**, or run:

```sh
~/.rubin-buddy/hooks.sh --codex
```

This merges Rick’s entries into `~/.codex/hooks.json`, preserves existing hooks,
and creates a one-time backup. **In Codex, open `/hooks`, review and trust
Rick’s definitions, then start a new session.** Configuration alone is not proof
of an active connection. Rick never changes hook trust or bypasses review.
Requires a Codex version supporting lifecycle hooks; this is not an integration
with ordinary ChatGPT conversations in a browser.

Undo with `~/.rubin-buddy/hooks.sh --codex --remove`. Uninstall removes both
Claude and Codex connections. The adapter stores only a hashed session ID,
provider, project directory’s final name, state, event name, and timestamp.
It does not retain hook prompts, tool inputs, code, or transcript paths.

Sources: [Codex hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks) ·
[Claude Code hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks).

### Standalone Mac app

The source installer remains the public install path. A signing-ready packager
is included: `sh build-mac.sh --unsigned` creates a local inspection bundle,
not a public download. With a Developer ID Application certificate and an
existing Keychain notarytool profile, set `RUBIN_SIGN_IDENTITY` and
`RUBIN_NOTARY_PROFILE`, then run `sh build-mac.sh`. It signs, notarizes,
staples, and assesses the bundle before producing `dist/Rick.zip`.
Standalone bundles use their own preferences and manual website-based updates;
source-installed Rick retains its existing automatic updates. Do not advertise
an unsigned inspection build as an ordinary consumer download.

### Checks before release

```sh
python3 tests/check_sessions.py
python3 tests/check_models.py
node build.js
node build-site.js
node --check site/preview.js
swiftc -O Buddy.swift -o /tmp/rick-compile-check
```

## Install

One line, macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://rick-buddy.netlify.app/install.sh | sh
```

He appears bottom-right, adds a menu bar icon, and starts at login from then on.

**Requirements:** macOS and the Xcode Command Line Tools. If you don't have them:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Nothing else — no Homebrew, no Node, no npm. The installer builds from source on
your machine, which is deliberate: a downloaded unsigned binary gets quarantined
by Gatekeeper and needs a right-click-open dance, while something you compiled
locally just runs. It also means you can read exactly what you're installing
before you run it.

Everything lands in `~/.rubin-buddy/`. Nothing is installed system-wide and
nothing needs `sudo`.

### Make him follow Claude Code

The installer asks — say yes. Already installed? Click the menu bar head →
**Follow Claude Code**. Either way it's the same thing underneath:

```bash
~/.rubin-buddy/hooks.sh
```

That merges eight hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`, keeping whatever's already
in there. Declining at install is remembered, so updates never nag. Open a new
Claude Code session and he'll start reacting:

| Claude Code event | What he does |
| --- | --- |
| You send a prompt | Both hands on the beard, a Claude-orange spark drifting up |
| A tool starts | One hand works down the beard — he's in the material |
| Claude needs you | Pushes his shades up onto his crown and holds your eye |
| Claude finishes | One slow nod, then back to breathing |

Undo it any time with `~/.rubin-buddy/hooks.sh --remove`.

## Menu bar

The bald silhouette with the shades. Everything lives there:

| Item | |
| --- | --- |
| Open Companion | Quick panel for status, thoughts, breathing, and a quiet sit |
| Sit with Me | 25 minutes of quiet company; stop any time |
| Saved Thoughts | Keep lines locally, copy text, or copy a picture to share |
| Text Size | 13, 15, 18, or 22 pt, independent of sprite size |
| Follow Codex | Adds Codex hooks; requires review and trust in Codex |
| Show / Hide Rick | Toggle without quitting |
| **Bring Him Back** | Drops him bottom-right on the main screen, shades up. The "I've lost him" button. |
| Stand on Your Window | Stands on the front window and jumps between them |
| Headphones with Music | Headphones on while music plays, from any app |
| Size | Tiny · Small · Medium · Large |
| Chatter | Silent · Quiet (5–15 min) · Normal (2.5–7 min) · Talkative (45 s–2 min) |
| Quiet for an Hour | One click before a meeting; restores itself. Unlike Silent, it can't be forgotten. |
| Pose | Play any animation directly |
| Say Something | A line on demand |
| Take a Breath | A guided minute — he sits, the bubble paces you |
| Follow Claude Code | Wires / unwires the hooks — same merge as `hooks.sh` |
| Start at Login | Writes / removes the launchd agent |
| Check for Updates · Auto-Update | See below |
| Quit Rick | |

Size, chatter and auto-update persist across restarts.

You can also **drag** him anywhere (his position is remembered — or, standing
on windows, where along the edge he stands), **click** him for a nod and a
line, or **right-click** him for the same menu.

## Updating

He checks for a new version 45 seconds after login and every 6 hours after that,
and updates himself when there is one — so if you got this from a friend, you get
their improvements automatically. Turn it off under **Auto-Update**, or force a
check with **Check for Updates**.

Manually:

```bash
~/.rubin-buddy/update.sh
```

Updating re-runs the installer, which **preserves an edited `lines.txt`** — if
you've customised what he says, your version stays and the new default is
written alongside as `lines.txt.new`. It knows the difference by remembering the
hash of whatever it shipped last time.

### Two things the updater got wrong first, in case you build one

**Never `cp` over a running executable.** The first version of the updater killed
him every single time it worked — `SIGKILL`, `Code Signature Invalid`,
`Taskgated Invalid Signature`. macOS validates code pages against the binary's
signature (ad-hoc counts) as it faults them in, so changing the bytes underneath
a live process invalidates pages it hasn't read yet. `install.sh` now writes to a
temp name and `mv`s it into place: `rename()` only swaps the directory entry, so
a running copy keeps its original inode and stays valid.

**`raw.githubusercontent.com` caches for about five minutes.** Fine for a
six-hourly poll, but it made a manual **Check for Updates** report the previous
version right after a release, which looks broken. The version check uses the
contents API with `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw` instead — uncached, and
60 requests/hour unauthenticated is far more than this needs — falling back to
raw if the API is unreachable.

He also holds an advisory `flock` on `~/.rubin-buddy/.lock`, so a second launch
prints `already running` and exits. Two of him would fight over the same state
file and saved position. The kernel drops the lock on exit however the process
goes, so unlike a pidfile a crash can't leave a stale one behind.

## What he says

Around 300 lines in `~/.rubin-buddy/lines.txt`, one per line, `#` for comments,
grouped into two dozen themes (the file is the source of truth for the count). He re-reads the file every time he speaks, so **edits land
live** — no rebuild, no restart.

He deals them from a **shuffled deck** rather than picking independently, so
every line plays before any repeats — and the deck **survives restarts**, so
auto-updates don't re-deal it. Contextual lines remember the last ~50 things he
said and avoid them. Independent picking gives a first repeat after
roughly 20 draws — under two hours on the default timing — which
would have wasted most of the deck.

### He speaks to the moment

The theme headers in `lines.txt` aren't just organization — the moment picks the
theme:

| Moment | Theme he draws from |
| --- | --- |
| A turn finishes (sometimes, 1 in 3) | *Finishing* — "It'll never feel finished. Ship it." |
| Claude has been waiting on you 3+ minutes | *Noticing* / *Taste* — you're the decision now |
| Two hours of unbroken work | *Stepping away* — "Go for a walk. It'll keep." |
| ~90 minutes at the machine without a real break | *The world* — "The screen will wait. The sunset won't." |
| A single task runs past ~10 minutes | He sits down and keeps watch; when it finally lands, the Finishing line is guaranteed |
| Your first arrival of the day (after 4+ hours away) | *Beginnings* / *Practice* — "Begin badly. Begin anyway." |
| Back after three or more days away | *Return* instead — "You were gone. Good." |
| Friday, the first quiet moment after 5pm | *Week's end* — "Enough for this week." Once a week |

Contextual lines share a 15-minute cooldown so he never gets chatty about it,
respect Silent mode, and fall back to the whole deck if you rename the groups.
Renaming or reordering groups in `lines.txt` is safe; the parser reads whatever
headers are there. (`RUBIN_CTX_FAST=1` compresses all the timings to seconds for
testing.)

### On the lines

They're **original phrasings**, not quotations. Pasting someone's copyrighted
text into a file that then presents it as an unattributed character line isn't a
thing to ship. But they aren't invented from nothing either — they're written
from his documented ideas:

- reduction over addition — early in his career he credited himself on records
  as having *reduced* them, not produced them
- getting the point across with the least information that still lands
- removing until the identity of the thing is challenged
- creativity as noticing rather than inventing
- taste over technique — he's said plainly he has no technical ability
- leaving the fewest fingerprints; state what you see and let the artist decide
- stepping away as part of the work, not a break from it
- beginner's mind, keeping useful mistakes, work that divides over work that bores

## Something wrong?

**Report a Problem** in his menu opens a GitHub issue pre-filled with your
version and macOS build. If he crashed or vanished, attach
`~/Library/Logs/rubin-buddy.log` — it contains only his own errors, nothing
personal. Or file directly: [issues](https://github.com/Gitmealez/rubin-buddy/issues),
or email [gonzalezot16@gmail.com](mailto:gonzalezot16@gmail.com) if GitHub isn't your thing.

Got a line he should say? There's a
[Suggest a line](https://github.com/Gitmealez/rubin-buddy/issues/new?template=suggest-a-line.md)
template — short, original phrasing, in his voice. Lines that land get added to
the deck and ship to everyone on the next update.

## Uninstall

```bash
~/.rubin-buddy/uninstall.sh
```

Removes the app, the launch agent, the log, his hooks in
`~/.claude/settings.json` (only his — the rest of the file is preserved, and
the pre-Rick original is backed up as `settings.json.rubin-bak`), and his
saved preferences.

---

# Working on him

Only needed if you want to change the sprite or the code. Node is required here
(it isn't for installing) because it generates the frames.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gitmealez/rubin-buddy.git
cd rubin-buddy
node build.js && swiftc -O Buddy.swift -o buddy
./buddy
```

`frames/` is committed on purpose, so installing needs only `swiftc` and never
Node.

Running from a checkout, he detects he isn't the managed install and skips
auto-updating — the menu shows "dev build" and tells you to `git pull` instead.

### Shipping a change to everyone

**Commit and push. That's the whole process.**

The `Release` workflow does the rest: it regenerates `frames/` from `sprite.js`,
bumps the patch `VERSION`, and commits both. Installed copies notice within six
hours and reinstall themselves. Two details make it safe:

- It only runs for pushes that touch the app — `Buddy.swift`, `sprite.js`,
  `frames/`, `lines.txt`, the shell scripts. A README or `site/` change deploys
  the website but doesn't restart anyone's buddy to deliver a typo fix.
- It ignores its own pushes (`github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'`), which is
  what stops the release commit triggering another release forever.

So `VERSION` is not something to edit by hand. If you do bump it manually, CI
will bump it again on top — harmless, just a wasted release.

Regenerate the website’s preview artwork and stable installer with `node build-site.js`.

The landing page at [rick-buddy.netlify.app](https://rick-buddy.netlify.app) is
`site/index.html`, deployed by Netlify on every push to `main`. The interactive preview uses the app’s exact frames and timings. It has no analytics, cookies, external fonts, or account requirement.

**Stop him before recompiling** (`pkill -x buddy`) — `swiftc -o buddy` writes in
place, and overwriting a live executable gets it killed for an invalid code
signature. `install.sh` avoids this with an atomic rename; a bare `swiftc` does
not. `pkill` also releases the single-instance lock.

Useful while working on him:

```bash
./buddy --version
./buddy --help
RUBIN_DEBUG=1 RUBIN_UPDATE_DELAY=5 ./buddy    # log animation + update decisions
```

## Layout

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `sprite.js` | The design. Pixel rows as strings, palette, poses, animations. |
| `build.js` | Writes `frames/*.png`, `frames/manifest.json`, the menu bar icon, and `preview.png`. |
| `png.js` | Zero-dependency PNG encoder. |
| `Buddy.swift` | The app: window, state watching, speech bubble, menu bar, updater. |
| `install.sh` | The one-liner. Also the updater — it's idempotent. |
| `update.sh` · `hooks.sh` | Thin wrappers around the above. |
| `state.sh` | Legacy script commands and session event entrypoint. |
| `session-event.py` | Minimal local status records for Claude and Codex. |
| `build-site.js` | Generates website preview assets and its stable installer. |
| `build-mac.sh` | Standalone app packaging and optional signing/notarization. |
| `lines.txt` | What he says. |
| `VERSION` | Automatically bumped by the release workflow. |

## How the pieces talk

He watches a one-word state file — `~/.rubin-buddy/state` — and plays whatever
animation is named in it. `state.sh` writes it, the hooks call `state.sh`. The
hooks are all `async: true` so they never block Claude Code, and `state.sh` exits
0 unconditionally. A desktop pet must never be why a hook fails.

Drive him by hand with any animation name:

```bash
~/.rubin-buddy/state.sh glasses
```

`idle` · `think` · `stroke` · `nod` · `glasses` · `unglasses` · `look` · `sitdown` · `meditate` · `standup` · `glance` · `adjust` · `stretch` · `tea` · `glint` · `groove` — plus two words that aren't animations: `breathe` starts a guided breath, and `say` borrows his voice:

```bash
~/.rubin-buddy/state.sh say "Deploy is green."
```

One bubble, once, capped at 140 characters — the quietest notification endpoint
on your Mac. Anything you can script can speak through him.

### Idle fidgets

Reacting to Claude Code turned out to be the smaller half of looking alive —
between turns he sat in a two-frame bob for minutes, which is most of what
anyone actually saw. So idleness has a life of its own now: he strokes the beard, sits
with a thought, pushes his shades up and looks around, glances about the room,
adjusts his shades, catches the light on them, stretches, or takes a slow sip
of tea — never the same gesture twice running. Coming to rest after work invites a gesture within
seconds; deeper quiet spaces them out to every half-minute or so. A real Claude Code event
cancels any fidget instantly and pushes the next one out, so fidgets only ever
happen in genuine quiet. (`RUBIN_CTX_FAST=1` compresses the timing for testing.)

The `nod` was also slowed from 0.6s to 1.3s — at the old tempo the "Claude
finished" gesture played once and nobody ever saw it.

### Long tasks, and late nights

When Claude works one task past ~10 minutes, he stops stroking the beard and
sits down to keep watch — patience reads better than manic looping. More events
from the same task don't stand him up; the Stop does, and a long run's ending
always earns its Finishing line. Past 11pm his idle becomes the seated pose
too: he sits with you, stands when something happens, settles back down.

### He meditates

When you've been away from the machine ~8 minutes, he sits down cross-legged
and breathes slower than usual — his own practice, not a reaction to you. When
you come back he just gets up. A sit you start yourself (Pose menu, or
`state.sh meditate`) is yours to end; only the ones he started on his own end
when you return.

### Take a Breath

One menu item. He sits, and the bubble paces four slow rounds — *In… hold…
out…* — about a minute, then he stands. No streaks, no history, no reminder.
Clicking him mid-breath means "enough"; he stands, nothing more. Scriptable via
`~/.rubin-buddy/state.sh breathe`.

### Mornings, and what he last said

Your first activity of each day earns one line, leaning toward *Beginnings* and
*Practice*. Come back from three or more days away — a trip, a weekend off the
grid — and it's a *Return* line instead ("The work kept. So did you."); he keeps
a once-a-minute note of when he last saw you so the gap survives the restart
that being gone usually involves. Late on a Friday, the first moment he's idle
and you're there, one *Week's end* line — once per week, and a Friday evening
that never goes quiet simply gets none.

And if you catch a bubble vanishing and wonder what it was, the
menu shows `He said: "…"` — click it to copy the line.

### Shade transitions

Each animation declares where the shades end up (`shades: 'up' | 'down'`), and
two are marked `transition: true` with a `from`: `glasses` (down→up) and
`unglasses` (up→down). Request an animation whose shade position doesn't match
where they are, and the player inserts the matching gesture first and queues your
request behind it — so he never hard-cuts from bare-eyed to shaded. Requesting a
transition that's already satisfied skips to where it would have landed instead of
bouncing. There are no hardcoded transitions in the Swift; it all comes from the
manifest.

## Environment knobs

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUBIN_SCALE` | `2.5` | Logical scale, decimals fine (snapped to device pixels) |
| `RUBIN_CHATTER` | `150-420` | Seconds of quiet between unprompted lines |
| `RUBIN_LINES` | `lines.txt` beside the binary | Where to read his lines from |
| `RUBIN_STATE` | `~/.rubin-buddy/state` | State file to watch |
| `RUBIN_FRAMES` | `frames/` beside the binary | Frame directory |
| `RUBIN_DEBUG` | off | `1` logs every animation change to stderr |
| `RUBIN_UPDATE_DELAY` | `45` | Seconds after launch before the first update check |
| `RUBIN_CTX_FAST` | off | `1` compresses every contextual timer to seconds, for testing |

`RUBIN_SCALE` and `RUBIN_CHATTER` given at launch override the remembered menu
choice for that run.

## Drawing him

Rows live in `sprite.js` as strings of palette characters (`k` outline, `s` skin,
`w` beard, `b` tee, `l` lens…). `buildRows()` asserts every row is exactly 24
characters and every character is a known colour, so a miscounted run fails the
build instead of quietly shearing the sprite. Rows are assembled from
`c('w', 14)`-style runs rather than typed out literally, for the same reason.
This caught three real mistakes while drawing him.

Constraints worth keeping if you redraw him:

1. **Beard over dome, heavily.** 4 rows of scalp against 16 rows of beard. Even
   proportions read as a garden gnome.
2. **Don't let the beard taper cleanly from the shoulders** — a perfect triangle
   turns the black tee into tuxedo lapels.
3. **Arms one shade lighter than the torso** (`n` vs `b`), or hands read as tan
   squares floating beside him.
4. **A hand on the beard needs its arm.** A bare 2×2 skin block on all that white
   is a smudge; the dark sleeve running back to the shoulder is what actually
   reads. See `strokePatch()`.
5. **Head rows 4–8 share a 12px interior**, which is what lets the shades slide up
   the face with no special-casing. Row 3 is only 10 wide, so the crown has its
   own narrower band — and mixing the two widths is what makes the pushed-up
   shades read as tilted rather than flat.

Two more since he started standing on windows: **every grounded pose keeps
its base on row 30** (standing feet and the seated base alike — the app puts
that line on a window's edge, and `baseline` in the manifest says how many
image rows hang below it), and **breathing moves the head, never the feet**
(`breathe()` shifts only the head band). `withShadow()`, applied in `build.js`,
lays the contact shadow into those rows below the line; animations marked `airborne`
get none, and `internal` ones (the hop, the headphones going on) stay out of
the Pose menu.

### The rim light

His tee is `#1f1c1c` and his outline `#17120f`, which on a dark desktop left only
the beard, face and hands reading — the body dissolved into the wallpaper.
`withRim()` pads the grid by a pixel, then lights every transparent pixel
touching the silhouette.

- **The rim is translucent** (`#f6f3ec` at ~61%). Against a dark desktop it lifts
  him off the background; against a light one it all but disappears. An opaque rim
  looks fine on dark and like a sticker outline on white.
- **8-connected, not 4.** Orthogonal-only leaves gaps on exactly the sloped edges
  — the beard taper, the dome — that most need separating.

It's applied in `build.js` as a post-process, so every animation gets it for free
and no row strings have to account for the extra pixel.

### Sizing

`scale` is a decimal, but each sprite pixel is snapped to a whole number of
**device** pixels before the window is sized — otherwise some sprite pixels land
on 4 device pixels and their neighbours on 5, which reads as a wobble along every
straight edge. So the same `scale` gives 65×85 on a 2× display and 78×102 on a 1×
one, and both are pixel-exact.

## The mixed-DPI crash, and why the anchor matters

Dragging him between a 2× laptop display and a 1× external monitor used to kill
him outright — `SIGSEGV`, stack exhausted. Worth writing down, because the fix
looks arbitrary until you see the loop.

The crash report's stack was the whole story: `mouseDragged` → `setFrameOrigin` →
`_updateSettingsSendingScreenChangeNotificationToScreen:` →
`NSWindow.didChangeScreenNotification` → `screenChanged()` → `setFrame` → the same
notification again, six nested copies before the report truncated.

`screenChanged()` resizes the window to re-snap the sprite pixels. Resizing
changes which display the window *most overlaps*, which is what `window.screen`
reports, which is what the old code fed back into the size calculation:

| Display | `backingScaleFactor` | pixel at scale 2.5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in Retina | 2.0 | 2.5 |
| 1× external | 1.0 | 3.0 |

Each pass picked the *other* display's value, resized, and re-fired. It only
happened while straddling the boundary — exactly what dragging between monitors
does.

Three changes:

1. **A reentrancy guard** (`adjustingScale`) so the resize can't re-enter the
   handler that triggered it.
2. **A stable anchor.** The scale comes from the display under the window's
   *origin*, not `window.screen`. `setFrame` keeps the origin fixed, so resizing
   can't change the answer — a fixed point instead of a feedback loop.
3. **The same anchor at startup.** `init` used `NSScreen.main`, so he'd come up at
   the laptop's scale even when parked on the external display.

Dragging him fully off every display is refused now too.

## Known rough edges

- He can't tell music from other sound: a talking video or a game puts the
  headphones on too. Calls don't, unless the microphone is off in an app he
  doesn't know is for calls.
- Standing on windows follows the front window of the front app. Apps that keep
  an invisible full-size window in front (rare) can leave him on its edge.
- Session hooks arrive asynchronously; their received order can differ from the agent’s event order. Per-session atomic files prevent one project from overwriting another. Inactive working sessions become “status unknown” after 30 minutes, not “finished.” Waiting and review states remain until the session changes or ends (up to seven days).
- If the display he's parked on is unplugged he's hauled back to the main screen's
  bottom-right, which loses his position. Better than being stranded, and "Bring
  Him Back" is there either way.
- The updater trusts this repo. That's inherent to any auto-updater — whoever
  controls the repo controls what your machine builds. `install.sh` is short and
  worth reading, and **Auto-Update** turns it off.
